## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)'s [Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) program. The goal of this proejct is build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that recognizes traffic signs.

All the code for this project is in the [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) noebook.

The file [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html) contains a HTML export of the notebook for online viewing.
